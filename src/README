Here are the changes to twm since revision 4.0.  I really suggest
you go read the man page, these descriptions are short.

1. You can now execute an f.function from a menu.

2. I added special menu called "TwmWindows" that lists all current windows,
   if a window is selected, "WindowFunction" is executed.  If "WindowFunction"
   is not set, the window is deiconified and raised.

3. You can now say NoTitle by itself and have all windows created without
   titlebars.

4. You can now raise and lower icons.  f.raise no longer de-iconifies and icon.

5. I added an f.deiconify function.  This does nothing to a window that is not
   an icon.

6. Added an f.forcemove function.  This allows you to move a window partially
   off the display if DontMoveOff is set.

7. You can now have DefaultFunction be an f.menu

8. I added an f.raiselower function.  If the window is not obscured, it 
   is lowered.  If it is obscured in any way, it is raised.

9. A window name can now be specified as a context to a function key.

10. The following variables have been added
	DecorateTransients
	IconifyByUnmapping
	DontIconifyByUnmapping
	IconManagerForeground
	IconManagerBackground
	IconManagerGeometry
	ShowIconManager
	IconManagerDontShow
	Zoom [count]
	NoBackingStore
	NoSaveUnder
	RandomPlacement

11. The following functions have been added.
	f.showiconmgr
	f.hideiconmgr
	f.zoom
	f.fullzoom
